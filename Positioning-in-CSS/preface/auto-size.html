        just as they can do very interesting things.<span style="position: absolute; top: auto; left:

        When we consider the effect of positioning, it quickly becomes clear that authors can do a great deal of damage to layout,
        just as they can do very interesting things.<span style="position: absolute; top: auto; left: auto;
right: 0; bottom: 0; height: 2em; width: 5em;">[4]</span> This is usually the case with useful technologies: the sword always

    First, if left, width, and right are all set to auto, then you get the result seen in the previous section: the left edge
    is placed at its static position, assuming a left-to-right language. In right-to-left languages, the right edge is placed
    at its static position. The width of the element is set to be “shrink to fit,” which means the element’s content area
    is made only as wide as necessary to contain its content. The nonstatic position property (right in left-to-right languages,
    left in right-to-left) is set to take up the remaining distance. For example:
